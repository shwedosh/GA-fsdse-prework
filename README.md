Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance to GreyAtom's FSDSE Program. We hope you are really excited!! We want you to get ready for the Program and have a smooth experience. This means there is some work to be done before the start of the program.

# Overview

This guide covers the following steps that you need to go through to prepare for the class.

* Setting up your operating system
* Setting up the version control system
* Pre-Reading Material
* Community and Meetups

The material in the *Pre-Reading Material* section is optional, but highly recommended.


# Setting up your operating system

* You can use either the Mac OS or Ubuntu 16.04 while working through the program.
* A note on hardware: your machine should have the `amd64` architecture. If you are not using an ancient machine, you should be fine.

## Mac OS

We'll be using `Homebrew` to install and manage packages.

* [Install `xcode` using this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/)
* [Install `brew` using this guide](https://brew.sh/)

## Ubuntu 16.04

You are already using Ubuntu? Just make sure you are using 16.04 LTS and you are all set.

## If you have Windows

You can follow any one of the following strategies:

1. Erase everything and install Ubuntu 16.04 to replace Windows
    - http://www.linuxtechi.com/install-ubuntu-16-04-with-screenshots/
    - https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop
    - https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/index.html
2. Setup Dual-Boot (you'll have both Windows and Ubuntu 16.04 in your machine)
    - Make sure you have someone experienced to assist you

    - http://www.tecmint.com/install-ubuntu-16-04-alongside-with-windows-10-or-8-in-dual-boot/
    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-alongside-a-pre-installed-windows-with-uefi

Using VMWare to run Ubuntu 16.04 from inside of Windows is **not recommended**.

In case you are new to Ubuntu, [here is a guide](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to get started.Installation related help available on [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Setting up Version Controlling System (Git and GitHub)

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* [Hands on Introduction to using Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD), video series (27 minutes)

Two companion blog posts:
* [Simple guide to forks](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/)
* [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/).

# Pre-Reading Material

 * [The Field Guide to Data Science](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/greyatom-social/Field-Guide-To-Data-Science.pdf) was put together by Booz Allen Hamilton includes a wide range of data science topics and reads comfortably, like a magazine.
 * [A Visual Introduction to Basic Statistics and Probability](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)
* [Analyzing the Analyzers](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/greyatom-social/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf):An Introspective Survey of Data Scientists and Their Work
* Read the first two chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/greyatom-social/The+Data+Science+Handbook.pdf)

## Blogs to Follow

We will share many more, when in the course, but here are some very good starting points

* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/data)
* [KDnuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)
* [yhat](http://blog.yhat.com/)

## Optional
You're also more than welcome to do the following if you're keen to get extra advanced for your the course, these concepts will be covered in the class as well :

* [Python Code Academy Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) An interactive, in-browser tutorial from Codecademy with 20+ modules and 200+ exercises. It is geared toward novice programmers
* [Khan Academy: Probability & Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability)


# Community and Meetups

## GreyAtom's Philosophy on Learning

### Learning is for everyone.
We've all got plenty of neuroplasticity left in us! No matter your background, you can learn what you want to learn. Believe that you can, and believe that those around you can too.
### Learning is a consequence of thinking.
Reading is one way of getting you to think about things that you wouldn't otherwise. Writing encourages thinking. Discussion encourages thinking. Being *active* encourages thinking. Do things! Try things! Think about things!
### We are all students. We are all teachers.
There's so much to know! We all learn from one another. Embrace opportunities to learn from others, and opportunities to share what you know.
### Communicate early and often.
We want to know what you're thinking
